    <h1>What is disability?</h1>
    <p>A disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities.
       The Persons of Disability Act 14 of 2003 defines ‘disability’ as meaning a disability: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>which is attributable to an intellectual, psychiatric, cognitive, neurological, sensory or physical impairment or a combination of those impairments</li>
      <li>which is permanent or likely to be permanent</li>
      <li>which may or may not be of a chronic or episodic nature</li>
      <li>which results in substantially reduced capacity of the person for communication, social interaction, learning or mobility and a need for continuing support services.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>With the assistance of appropriate aids and services, the restrictions experienced by many people with a disability may be overcome.</p>
    
    <h1>Types of disability</h1>
    <p>The main categories of disability are physical, sensory, psychiatric, neurological, cognitive and intellectual. Many people with disability have multiple disabilities.</p>
    <p>A physical disability is the most common type of disability, followed by intellectual and sensory disability. Physical disability generally relates to disorders of the musculoskeletal, circulatory, respiratory and nervous systems.</p>
    <p>Sensory disability involves impairments in hearing and vision.</p>
    <p>Neurological and cognitive disability includes acquired disability such as multiple sclerosis or traumatic brain injury.
       Intellectual disability includes intellectual and developmental disability which relate to difficulties with thought processes, learning, communicating, remembering information and using it appropriately, making judgments and problem solving.
       Intellectual disability is the result of interaction between developmentally attributable cognitive impairment, attitudinal and environmental barriers.</p>
    <p>Psychiatric disorders resulting in disability may include anxiety disorders, phobias or depression.</p>
    
    <h1>What is Disability Literacy?</h1>
    <p>Basic disability literacy means that navigator organizations and Navigators themselves are aware of the elements of disability etiquette involving how to refer to and interact with people with disabilities.
       It also means that Navigators are aware of the need for physical accessibility of the offices where they meet with consumers and methods to ensure that communication with people with disabilities is effective both by telephone and in person.
       Disability literacy implies that navigator organizations have adequate internal, organizational capacity to provide accommodations when consumers request them or they are needed. 
       In the context of the Marketplace, organizational disability literacy also involves being able to recognize the need for and identify the specific,
       unique health care services and benefits that people with disabilities may require, and the capacity to help them assess and understand their insurance options.</p>
