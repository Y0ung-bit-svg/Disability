    <h1>What is disability?</h1>
    <p>A disability is any continuing condition that restricts everyday activities.
       The Persons of Disability Act 14 of 2003 defines ‘disability’ as meaning a disability: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>which is attributable to an intellectual, psychiatric, cognitive, neurological, sensory or physical impairment or a combination of those impairments</li>
      <li>which is permanent or likely to be permanent</li>
      <li>which may or may not be of a chronic or episodic nature</li>
      <li>which results in substantially reduced capacity of the person for communication, social interaction, learning or mobility and a need for continuing support services.</li>
    </ul>
